Game Development Notes 2/27/12

Arcade Gold Rush Model

Waterfall Model
	-Flows in one direction

Agile Model
	-Iterative, can backtrace during the development process
	-Need to hire people who work fast, can get on same page
	
Sid Process
	-Prototype
	-Play the game for a while and get the basics right
	-Now get other players to look at the game
	-Carefully observe the players
	-Constantly reward player in game
	-Throw in the testers
	-Make the game harder until player begs for mercy
	
Physics
	Position and Velocity
	(x,y)         (dx,dy)
	
	Calculation:
		scale_x = cos(angle)
		scale_y = sin(angle)
		dx = speed * scale_x
		dy = speed * scale_y
		x += dx
		y += dy
		
		Acceleration:
			dx += accel
			x += dx

Collision Detection
	Detection:
		Coordinates
		Bounding Box
			+ Quick, dirty
			+ Easy to implement
			- Not entirely accurate, wasted space
		Bounding Circle
			+ See above
			- Could be worse, more wasted space
		Polygon Outline of Object
			+ Accurate
			- Too slow to render outline
		Pixel Detection
			ex. Duck Hunt
