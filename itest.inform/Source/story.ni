"itest" by Ben Leiken
The White Room is a room with a door to the east "The description of The White Room is black curtains near the station. Black-roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings. Silver horses run down moonbeams on your eyes. East is The Garden of Eden."

The player is in the White Room.

Say "it is dark."

The Garden of Eden is a room. It is east of The White Room.
